## Description

The simple shell is an simple application that reads lines from the terminal, interprets them, and executes them. This shell includes simple basic functionality of a traditional Unix-like command line user interface. Standard functions and system calls employed in simple_shell include: `stat, execve, exit, fork, free, getline, malloc, perror, wait, write.`

## Requirements

simple_shell is designed to run in the `Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS` linux environment and to be compiled using the GNU compiler with flags`-Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, and -pedantic.`

## Installation

   - Compile: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh`
   - Run the shell in interactive mode: `./hsh`
   - Run the shell in non-interactive mode:
   - Example `echo "ls -l" | ./hsh`


## Usage

After compilation, the resulting program can run in interactive or non-interactive mode.

#### Interactive Mode

In interactive mode, simply run the program and wait for the prompt to appear. From there, you can type commands freely,

Example `pwd` , `ls -l`, `echo "Hola mundo!"`, `etc.`

#### Non-Interactive Mode

In non-interactive mode, echo your desired command and pipe it into the program like this:

```sh
echo "ls" | ./hsh
```

In non-interactive mode, the program will exit after finishing your desired command(s).

#### Included Built-Ins

Our shell has support for the following built-in commands:

| Command             | Definition                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| exit                | Exit the shell, with an optional exit status, n.                                          |
| env                 | Print the environment.                                                                    |
